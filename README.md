# Python-project---Building-an-alarm-clock
Overview
This Python project implements a simple alarm clock using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The goal is to create an alarm clock that allows users to set alarms for specific times in a 24-hour format.

Libraries Used:

Tkinter
Tkinter is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, commonly used for developing graphical user interfaces. In this project, Tkinter is utilized to create the interface for setting the alarm time.

Winsound
The winsound module provides access to sound-playing functionality on Windows platforms. It is used in this project to play a sound when the alarm is triggered.

time
The time module in Python offers various time-related functions. In this project, it introduces delays and synchronizes the alarm triggering.

datetime
The datetime module simplifies access to attributes associated with dates, times, and time zones. It is used to handle and parse time-related information in this alarm clock project.

Usage
1.Run the program by executing the Python script (e.g., python alarm_clock.py).
2.A dialog box will appear, presenting a user interface to set the alarm time.
3.Enter the desired hour, minutes, and seconds for the alarm.
4.Wait for the specified time, and the alarm will ring, notifying you.

How to Set the Alarm
1.Launch the program.
2.Enter the desired hour, minutes, and seconds using the provided input fields.
3.Click the "Set Alarm" button.
4.The program will display a message confirming that the alarm has been set.
5.Wait for the specified time, and the alarm will be triggered.
